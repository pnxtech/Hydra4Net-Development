Hydra for .NET is a library for building microservices.

## Caution
This is an experimental release of an implementation of Hydra for .NET. Years ago (7 now) Hydra for NodeJS was built to leverage the power of Redis for building microservices. Teh early Hydra offers features such as service discovery, distributed messaging, message load balancing, logging, presence, and health monitoring. It was announced at EmpireNode 2016.
